Despite these models being inexact at capturing the complexities of real-world disease transmission, they are capable of providing meaningful insight into physical systems and can ultimately support decision-making. These models use input parameters that represent characteristics of the physical system of interest.

Hence, statistical calibration, or the process of identifying the optimal values of these parameters to best fit the observed data, is utilized to improve predictions and reliability of the model.\nAlthough declared an eradicated disease in the United States in 2000, there has been recent attention on several measles outbreaks throughout the country, most notably an outbreak beginning in Gaines County, Texas at the start of 2025. Here, we employ a dynamic compartmental model, known as an SVEIR model, to study the transmission of measles. We perform four different statistical calibration methods on the SVEIR model using daily incidence data from the West Texas outbreak collected by the Texas Department of State Health Services. We report estimated parameter values and basic reproduction numbers for the model calibrated using different methods. We give a comparison of predictive root mean square errors of all calibration methods and find that the optimal prediction calibration method returned the lowest predictive error. This study highlights the differences in calibration methods, hopes to provide an improved understanding of the current state of the ongoing measles outbreak in West Texas, and underscores avenues for future analysis."

    "text": "Predicting Deep Sea Coral Growth in Davidson Seamount Using Gradient Boosted Machines\nUndergraduate Capstone at St. Edward’s University\nAdvisor: Paul Savala\nAlthough the largest ecosystem on Earth, the deep ocean is also the least explored and understood. Hence, we are still in need of properly integrated biodiversity studies to unlock the patterns controlling species diversity in cold-water coral habitats. This study is specific to Davidson Seamount, a volcano located about 80 kilometers off the central California coast in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Predictive modeling has only recently been developed and applied in the marine environment due to the remoteness and limited accessibility of this environment. The objectives of this study were to develop and validate interpretable models to predict the occurrence of deep sea species of coral and sponges in Davidson Seamount.\nFor this study we utilized a subset tailored to Davidson Seamount of coral records from the Deep-Sea Coral Research and Technology Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The dataset contains information about deep sea corals and sponges collected by NOAA and their partners and is specifically tailored to the occurrences of azooxanthellates. Additionally, we utilized hydrographic records obtained from California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI). CalCOFI hydrographic data consists of the physical seawater properties measured over a 69 year time-series. The dataset contains seawater measurements from bottle sample depths. Our precise implementation will take the form of a glassbox explainable boosting machine, which are a special form of gradient boosted decision trees. The present research is the first to investigate coral growth in Davidson Seamount using interpretable models. Our results show that the most important factors influencing coral growth given the data include depth, temperature, salinity, dynamic height, and potential density. Our model reveals the most favorable conditions involving these factors for the occurrence of different coral in Davidson Seamount."
